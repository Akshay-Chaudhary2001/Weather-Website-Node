# Weather-Website-Node
This is a Live Weather Project hosted on heroku. 

This is made using the following technologies:
1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. Handlebars
4. Postman

This was deployed using Jenkins - which is running in a Docker Container deployed in a Kubernetes Cluster. I know this can sound confusing but the truth is it is.
